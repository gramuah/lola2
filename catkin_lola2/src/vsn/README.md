# Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) Package

## Description
The ROS Autonomous Navigation Package is designed to deploy artificial intelligence models capable of autonomous navigation. 
The package contains a client that interacts with the discrete_move package, 
which is responsible for performing the discrete movements inferred by the AI model.

Additionally. This package contains a node called image_preprocessing that is responsible for connecting
to the camera via ROS topic and returning an RGB or RGB+D image in the form of a NumPy array.

VSN package is designed to be a template that can be easily customized to deploy any AI model. 
By using the discrete_move service, the robot can execute the movements generated by the model in a precise and controlled manner.

# Dependencies
This package has been developed in Python3 and requires the following dependencies:
* ROS Noetic. 
* Numpy Python Library
* Sys Python Library

# Installation

To use this package you must follow the next steps:

1. Open a terminal and compile the package.

```shell
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```

2. Load the package into the ROS environment.

```shell
. devel/setup.bash
```

# How to use
To use this package, first ensure that the discrete_move package is properly installed and configured. Then, modify the AI
model as necesaryto ensure that it generates discrete movements that can be executed by discrete_move package.

Once the AI model is prepared, follow these steps:

1. Launch the discrete_move server node to move the robot:
```shell
roslaunch discrete_move lola_server.launch
```
2. Launch the vsn client node with the AI model:
```shell
roslaunch vsn vsn.launch
```

The vsn node will connect to the AI model and send it commands to generate movements. 
These movements will be executed by the discrete_move server node.
